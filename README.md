### 📦 Want the Full Source Code?

Creating a project like this takes **a lot of time, effort, and expertise**. Unfortunately, many people skip the learning process and come straight for the source code without watching the tutorial.

> ⚠️ **The source code is not available for free**.  
> Too many people ignore the video and just download the code, which defeats the purpose of sharing knowledge.

This project is meant for those who **truly want to learn**. If you're serious about understanding how it works, I encourage you to **watch the full tutorial video first**. It’s created to help you learn step by step.
